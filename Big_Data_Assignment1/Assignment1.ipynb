After this, each small part would be for probing and the climateData table would be for hashing, since we assume we only use 4 processors and each small part then is still larger than the climateDate (only 366 records). The reason why we skipped the disjoint partitioning-based join algorithm for this task is both hash data partitioning and range data partitioning cause some issues. Firstly, the hash-data partitioning would lead to large hash table because the hash-key would be the date attribute. Secondly, range data partitioning would cause serve skew problem (uneven problem) no matter how we distribute the range (based on seasons or just the month or day which can cut the whole table into

For the search part, we simply use a linear search to perform the searching process serially based the join result. One reason is that the joint result is not sorted or not in order, which is not suitable for binary search. Another reason is performing parallel searching requires data partitioning again.

For `merge sort` is an identical comparison-based sorting algorithm whose time complexity is O(nlgn) while quick-sort is just quick in implementation but the worst case can be n^2. And both of the two sorting algorithms has the same time complexity since they all use divide and conquer and are divided in a binary way.\n","\n","Thus in term parallel sorting I am using the

That is good load balance (even distribution). Hash data partitioning leads to large hash table due to the date (hash key) and range data partitioning causes uneven problem (severe skew issue). \n","\n","For the group by algorithm, we use traditional group by method (merge all group by). This is because the group by attribute is date and redistributing local aggregation results based on date does not change a lot. If we assume four processors would be used, then the parallel time spent on redistribution would be around 25% of the time spent by one processor who performs this redistribution serially. But after that, the global aggregation still requires each processor to do the aggregation parallelly and this would take around the same time to access the redistributed data set. The above explanation about redistribution is based on the current data (fireData), which is not a large data set compared to other data sets in reality.
